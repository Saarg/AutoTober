## Devtober

Devtober is a twitter challenge challenging people to make a game in one mount, one feature everyday.
I did this challlenge on my free time outside of my work using two assets I made in the past:
- Arcade_Car_Physics: Car script behaviour and ghost currently waiting for approval on the asset store
- MultiOsControls: Input managment simplifing working with multiple input configuration and controllers. Will be on the asset store when I get the time to add xinput support as there is currently issues with controllers in unity.

## Description
In this game you're released with your trusty old car in a skeleton infested village. You need to reach the end of the race crossing every checkpoint while scoring as much point as you can. Take your time but not too much or you'll lose points.

There is only one map currently but feel free to make new ones and submit them to me.
